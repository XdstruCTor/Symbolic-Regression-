# Symbolic Regression in Julia

This repository contains a Jupyter notebook (`SymbolicRegression.ipynb`) demonstrating the use of symbolic regression in Julia. Symbolic regression is a technique used to discover mathematical expressions that best fit a given dataset. The notebook uses the `SymbolicRegression` and `MLJ` packages to perform symbolic regression and machine learning tasks.

## Overview

### 1. Installation of Required Packages
The notebook begins by installing the necessary Julia packages, including:
- `SymbolicRegression`: For symbolic regression tasks.
- `MLJ`: A machine learning framework in Julia.

### 2. Introduction to Symbolic Regression
Symbolic regression (SR) is an algorithm that searches for mathematical expressions to fit a dataset. The notebook explains how the algorithm works, including the use of operators like `+`, `-`, `*`, and functions like `cos`.

### 3. Dataset Preparation
A synthetic dataset is created with two features (`a` and `b`) and a target variable `y`. The target variable is generated using a mathematical expression involving `cos`, and noise is added to simulate real-world data.

### 4. Model Training
The `SRRegressor` model is initialized with specific binary and unary operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `cos`). The model is trained on the dataset using the `MLJ` framework.

### 5. Interpretation of Results
The notebook explains how to interpret the results of symbolic regression, including:
- **Complexity**: The number of nodes in the expression.
- **Loss**: The mean squared error (MSE) between the predicted and actual values.
- **Score**: A metric balancing loss and complexity.
- **Equations**: The candidate expressions generated by the algorithm.

### 6. Low-Level Interface
The notebook demonstrates a lower-level interface for symbolic regression using the `equation_search` function. This allows more control over the search process and is used to find the best-fitting equations for a different dataset.

### 7. Pareto Frontier
The concept of the Pareto frontier is introduced, which helps in selecting the best models that balance complexity and accuracy. The notebook shows how to calculate and interpret the Pareto frontier.

### 8. Constructing Expressions
The notebook demonstrates how to manually construct mathematical expressions using the `Expression` type in Julia. This is useful for validating hypothesized relationships or initializing the symbolic regression process.

### 9. Evaluation of Expressions
The notebook shows how to evaluate the constructed expressions on the dataset and check if they are successful in fitting the data.

### 10. Summary and Conclusion
The notebook concludes by summarizing the key points and discussing the trade-offs between model complexity and accuracy in symbolic regression.
